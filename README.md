### Notes

Not having a design system (or at least style guide) to fall back on when writing forms is proving to be a pain.
For example, what is a disabled button supposed to look like? Should there be an outline around the selected button? How do you track progress through a multi-step form? (A progress bar? Is that responsive?)
